# üèÖ Data Mining Project 1: Olympic Medals Analysis

## Overview
This project explores trends in Olympic medal counts with a focus on the United States and its competitors.  
We investigate questions such as:
- Did global events (e.g., the collapse of the Soviet Union) influence medal trends?
- Do team sports (where entire rosters receive medals) artificially inflate medal counts?

The analysis is performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook (`olympicproject1.ipynb`) and a dataset (`summer.csv`) of Olympic results.

## Dataset
- **File:** `summer.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains Summer Olympic Games results from 1896-2012 for multiple countries, including event, athlete, year, and medal type.  
- **Source:** Kaggle Olympic dataset

## Methods
The notebook walks through:
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   - Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.  
   - Summarizing medal counts by country and year.  

2. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Plotting U.S. medal totals over time.  
   - Comparing U.S. performance against other top nations.  
   - Highlighting key historical periods (e.g., Cold War, post-Soviet era).  

3. **Factors Considered**  
   - Team vs. individual sports.  
   - Geopolitical shifts (e.g., boycotts, dissolution of the USSR).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

---

## Results & Insights
- The U.S. began to consistently outperform other nations after World War II.  
- The Soviet Union was the main competitor until its collapse in the early 1990s.  
- Team events significantly inflate medal counts in certain years, influencing country totals.
